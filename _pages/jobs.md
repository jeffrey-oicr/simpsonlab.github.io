We are currently looking for two research associates to join the group - one will focus on detecting base modifications using nanopore sequencing data and the other will focus on applying nanopore sequencing to cancer genomes. Details and application instructions are in the linked OICR careers page but please feel free to send me informal questions or a CV directly.
