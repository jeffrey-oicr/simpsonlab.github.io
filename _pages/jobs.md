We are currently looking for two postdocs to join the group - one will focus on [detecting base modifications using nanopore sequencing](https://www.recruitingsite.com/csbsites/oicr/JobDescription.asp?JobNumber=816948) data and the other will focus on [applying nanopore sequencing to cancer genomes](https://www.recruitingsite.com/csbsites/oicr/JobDescription.asp?JobNumber=816941). Details and application instructions are in the linked OICR careers page but please feel free to send me informal questions or a CV directly.
